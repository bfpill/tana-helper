# tana-helper
Simple API service that provides a variety useful API services to complement your daily use of [Tana](https://tana.inc)

All payloads are in JSON (with the exception of one, documented below). All results are in Tana paste format unless otherwise stated.

# Installation
`tana-helper` includes a python base API service and a React Typescript web app.

You will need to install a number of python tools to run the service. You only need to install TypeScript tools if you want to develop and change the configuration webapp, since this project includes a pre-built webapp in the git repo.

First, using a terminal app, clone this git repo:

`git clone https://github.com/verveguy/tana-helper.git`

And change into the source directory before proceeding.

`cd tana-helper`

## Python setup
You will need `python3` already installed as well as `virtualenv`

NOTE: Your version of python3 should be at least 3.9. Check it with `python3 --version`

Upgrade python3 in whatever fashion you choose ([homebrew](https://brew.sh) is good on Mac)

You can install `virtualenv` via:

`pip install virtualenv`

Create a virtualenv called `env` and activate it

`python3 -m venv env` 

For Mac/Linux:

`source env/bin/activate`

For Windows 11:

 `.\\env\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`
 
 If you have problems doing this due to "Execution Policy", open PowerShell as Administrator and do `set-executionpolicy remotesigned`. This should let you run the virtualenv `Activate.ps1` script)

## TypeScript setup
This is needed for the web UI components:

Install `node` and `yarn` for your operating system.

# Build & Run

If you want to update an existing installation of `tana-helper` or you are developing enhancements, first, make sure you have the latest version of the code.

`git pull`

## Building the service

You will then need to install the various python packages required by the service. This list changes from time to time.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You will also want to build the webapp UI:

Then while in the `tana-helper` directory:

`yarn install`

`yarn build`

## Run the service

Then you can start the service:

`uvicorn src.main:app`

(If you want to hack on `tana-helper`, run it with `--reload` to ease development iterations)

## Experimental deployment to Deta Space
If you want to host this service somewhere, there's experimental support for Deta Space in the main branch. Learn more about Deta Space [here](https://deta.space/).

However, there's something wrong with Tana Proxy fetch right now...

# Usage

There's a few different services provided by tana-helper: you may not want all of them.
You can remove services by modifying the file `src/main/py`. Comment out the line for the service you don't want.

Each has a Tana template associated with it (links below)

## Graph Visualizer!

Inspired by the marketing visualization on the Tana.inc website, `tana-helper` provides a 3D visualization of your Tana workspace.

Check out this [video demo](https://share.cleanshot.com/7J6d6F6l)

For details, see [Visualizer README](docs/README_VISUALIZER.md)

## Webhooks support!

Based on the inspiring example from @houshuang (see [recording](https://share.cleanshot.com/PNDJjGp4)), `tana-helper` now provides a powerful form of webhook processing.

Basically, you can shovel any text, email, etc at the `/webhook/<tana_type>` endpoint and it will process it into JSON using OpenAI and push the resulting JSON into Tana via the [Tana Input API](https://help.tana.inc/tana-input-api.html).

So you can call this webhook from pretty much any integration platform such as Zapier or for email, use the [cloudmailin.com](https://cloudmailin.com) service as @houshuang did.

See [Webhooks README](docs/README_WEBHOOKS.md) for more details.

## Pinecone support

Pinecone is a vector database that lets you take arbitrary chunks of text, turn them into "embeddings" (vectors) via OpenAI and then store. Why do this? So that you can take some other chunk of text, turn it into a vector and then use that vecotr to _query your Pinecone database_.

This is a very powerful idea. It basically means Tana can have full semantic similarity search today, while we wait for Tana themselves to make this magical as part of the product.

For details, see the Tana templates located at [https://app.tana.inc/?bundle=cVYW2gX8nY.G3v4049e-A](https://app.tana.inc/?bundle=cVYW2gX8nY.G3v4049e-A)

See [Pinecone README](docs/README_PINECONE.md) for more details.

## Pushing nodes to inline references support

This is a useful addition to Tana depending on your workflow. Basically, it lets you take notes from say, a meeting, where you've used inline refs to link the note to various concept nodes and then "push" the new note to those concept nodes rather than just relying on the backlinks UI in Tana. (Which I find very limiting and disruptive to my reading flow)

`/inlinerefs` Given a node, finds and returns all inline refs as fields in Tana paste format.

See the [Tana template](https://app.tana.inc/?bundle=cVYW2gX8nY.Eb8g90_U2G) for more information.

## Python exec() helper

Ever want to run some chunk of code inside Tana? Well, now you can (kinda).

`/exec` Executes an arbitrary chunk of python code passed as a parameter. Useful for adding simple functions to Tana.

`/exec_loose` Same thing, but without the strict JSON format parameters requirement. Allows use of Tana formatted code nodes.

See the [Tana template](https://app.tana.inc/?bundle=cVYW2gX8nY.l7dQ2eDwJK) for more information.

### JSON Proxy helper

Makes it easier to call external services that expect JSON. Let's you proxy requests to the external service via `tana-helper`, converting Tana nodes on the way in to JSON and converting JSON responses back to Tana nodes on the way back.

### Calendar API stuff

The Calendar API previously supported by tana-helper has been moved out to [tana-calendar-helper](https://github.com/verveguy/tana-calendar-helper).
Why? These features are only available on a local Mac and so it was confusing to have Mac-only features in this service, which is intended to be run on a hosted server supporting team usage. It also let me rewrite the calendar helper in go for portability on different Mac architectures whereas this project is now pythonic.

## Self bootstrapping into Tana

(NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. SEE `/usage`)


## Prerequisites

A number of the capabilities of `tana-helper` need OpenAI and other services.

You will need an OpenAI account that can access the `text-embedding-ada-002` model. (This is configurable, but is the only model currently tested.)

You will also need a Pinecone account and will need to create a Pinecone index within a Pinecone "environment" (Region). The default index name is `tana-helper` although this can also be configured.

## Configuration
This service is intended to be run as a local server. It also has some experimental support for hosting on Deta Space. See [Webhooks README](docs/README_WEBHOOKS.md) for details.
